## Savings Account API with ASP.Net and MSSQL - README

This document outlines a Savings Account API built using ASP.Net and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL). 

**Functionalities:**

* **Create Account:** This API endpoint allows users to create new savings accounts. It might require user authentication (not covered in this basic example). 
* **Deposit:** Users can deposit funds into their existing savings accounts using this endpoint. Authentication and authorization (checking account ownership) are crucial for deposits.
* **Withdraw:** This endpoint facilitates withdrawals from savings accounts. Implementations should consider sufficient balance checks and potential limitations.
* **Get Balance:** Users can retrieve their current account balance through this API call.
* **Account Details (Optional):** You can optionally include an endpoint to retrieve essential information about a user's savings account, such as account number, creation date, etc.

**Benefits:**

* **Modular Design:** This API provides a well-defined interface for interacting with savings accounts within a larger application.
* **Scalability:** The API approach facilitates easier integration with various applications or services. 
* **Security:** The API can leverage ASP.Net's security features like authentication and authorization to control access to account data.

**Technology Stack:**

* **ASP.Net:** This API is built using ASP.Net, a popular web development framework from Microsoft.
* **MSSQL:** Microsoft SQL Server is used as the relational database to store savings account data securely.

**Database Design (Basic Example):**

The MSSQL database might include tables like:

* **SavingsAccounts:** This table would store core account information (account number, owner ID, balance, etc.).
* **Transactions (Optional):**  A separate table can track transaction history (deposit/withdrawal amount, timestamp, etc.).

**Security Considerations:**

* Implement strong authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access and modify account information through the API.
* Enforce authorization rules to restrict access to specific accounts based on user roles or permissions.
* Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks.
* Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission between clients and the API.
